### Design a simple bank account management system with the following functionalities:
• Initialize a bank account with a given account holder's name and initial balance.
• Deposit a specified amount into the account.
• Withdraw a specified amount from the account (if sufficient balance is available).
• Check the current balance of the account.
Consider the following class:
BankAccount: Represents a bank account with attributes such as account holder's name, balance, and methods
to deposit, withdraw, and check balance.
Implement this class in an object-oriented manner with appropriate methods and attributes. You can assume that
the account starts with a zero balance and that the withdrawal amount cannot exceed the current balance.
